# List Assessments

> Sample list assessment request to assessment partner:

```shell
GET 'https://www.partner.com/api/list_assessments?partner_account_id=12345'
```

LaunchPad will first need to retrieve the list of assessments from the Assessment Partner using the `list_assessments` API endpoint. We will show the list of available assessments to the user, who will to select the appropriate 3rd party assessment to be included in a LaunchPad Assessment Flow.

Third party assessment IDs can be manually added into LaunchPad if necessary.
